# libchat-custom
Creates a pull-up chat on the bottom of the web page that utilizes LibChat's widgets. Automatically detects a small (phone) screen size and uses a pop-out chat instead.

This basically places a LibChat chat box inside of a nice pull up menu. 

It switches to a pop out (new window) on mobile phones (small screen width)

It requires both a Pop Out Widget, an In Page Widget, and a Slide Up Widget to be created in LibChat first.

It could be modified to encapsulate any chat service.
